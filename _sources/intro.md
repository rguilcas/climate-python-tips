# Robin's Climate Python Tips

**Hi everyone !** 

I'm Robin, and welcome to my blog. I am a PhD student working on climate science at the Universit√© de Toulouse in France and I work quite a lot with Python. I started doing Python for climate science back when I was a research intern during my master's degree. Throughout the years, I have learnt some things that I wish I could have learnt earlier, which is why I started this blog! I will share tips and infos on how I use python for my research. Hope you enjoy !
